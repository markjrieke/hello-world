### TaskTracker_v2.xlsm
This macro-enabled workbook simplifies reporting. At Siemens, time spent working directly on customer projects must be recorded to accurately bill against a project's engineering budget. This file takes the guesswork out of the process by allowing users to "clock in" and "clock out" of customer specific tasks. Weekly summaries for each project are listed on the Summary tab.
