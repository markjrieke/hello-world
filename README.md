### TaskTracker_v2.xlsm
This macro-enabled workbook simplifies reporting. At Siemens, time spent working directly on customer projects must be recorded to accurately bill against a project's engineering budget. This file takes the guesswork out of the process by allowing users to "clock in" and "clock out" of customer specific tasks. Weekly summaries for each project are listed on the Summary tab. An anonymized version of my workbook is found in this repo.

### Personal Health.xlsx
I use this workbook to track my caloric intake goals. Logging calories in the myFitnessPal app, I keep track of the long term targets, actuals, and 7 day moving average (Excel doesn't have a built-in LOESS curve). I've anonymized the scales & locked the sheets for editing, but this gives a good overview of the dashboard I use. Uploaded 5/5/21.
